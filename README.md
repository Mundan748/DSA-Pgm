# 📚 Basic Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Data Structures** using the **C programming language**. These are beginner-friendly programs designed to demonstrate how common data structures work internally, without using any built-in libraries.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

Each program is written in a modular and menu-driven format to help you interactively understand the structure and logic.

### ✅ Implemented Programs

- **Stack using Array**
  - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, Display
  - Includes overflow and underflow checks

- **Stack using Linked List**
  - Dynamic memory-based stack operations

- **Queue using Array**
  - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, Rear, Display
  - Includes circular queue version *(optional)*

- **Queue using Linked List**
  - Dynamically allocates space for queue elements

- **Singly Linked List**
  - Insert (beginning, end, position)
  - Delete (beginning, end, position)
  - Search, Traverse

- **Doubly Linked List** *(if available)*
  - Forward and backward traversal
  - Efficient insertions/deletions from both ends

- **Circular Linked List** *(if available)*

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run
